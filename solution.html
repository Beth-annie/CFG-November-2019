  <p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/"> Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
    internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
    Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why... </p>

  <ol><li>You can understand what is going on 'under the hood'</li>
  <li>Not having to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website!</li>
  <li>It's fun!</li></ol>

  <h2><i>What do you need to create a website?</i></h2>

  <p>Not much!</p>

  <ul><li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
  <li id="low">A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
  <li id="lower">A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
  <li id="lowest">Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li></ul>

<p>Follow my progress on <a href="https://github.com"> github</a> I have created a repository on it!</p>
